# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a summary of the Pyber ride-sharing data by city type.  This analysis will present total weekly fares for each city type in a multi-line graph by using Pandas and Matplotlib. The information presented will show how the ride-sharing data is different among city types and how those differences could be used by Pyber.

## Results
As seen from the table below, there are some differences amongst the city types.  The highest number of rides came from the urban cities as well as total drivers and total fares, followed by the suburban and rural city types.  The rural areas require longer distances which equates to a higher average fare per ride and an average fare per driver.  The urban rides are shorter and the average fare per ride is lowest as well as the average fare per driver.  The suburban rides fall in the middle.
