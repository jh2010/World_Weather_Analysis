# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a summary of the Pyber ride-sharing data by city type.  This analysis will present total weekly fares for each city type in a multi-line graph by using Pandas and Matplotlib. The information presented will show how the ride-sharing data is different among city types and how those differences could be used by Pyber.
